# Data Cleaning Project

## Overview
This mini project utilizes the raw data from Alex the Analyst's Power BI tutorial series. The original dataset can be found [here](https://github.com/AlexTheAnalyst/Power-BI/blob/main/Power%20BI%20-%20Final%20Project.xlsx).

## Data Cleaning Process

### Step 1: Check Duplicates, Missing Data, Faulty Data
- Investigate the dataset for any duplicates, missing values, or faulty data that could impact the analysis.

### Step 2: Drop Unnecessary Columns
- Identify and drop any columns that are not relevant to the analysis, reducing the dataset to essential information.

### Step 3: Prepare Data for Further Analysis
- Perform tasks such as creating ranges, generating category columns, and exploring natural language processing techniques to enhance the dataset for subsequent analyses.

## Jupyter Notebook
For detailed implementation and code, refer to the Jupyter Notebook in this repository.
